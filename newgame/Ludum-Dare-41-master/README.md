The target of the game is to reignite the star with highest possible score.
This game tries to combine idle gaming (think cookie clicker) with some action.

Controls:
- Click star to increase its gravitational pull. This also increases danger level
- Use 'A' and 'D' or arrows to move your ship
- Use 'Space' to pause the game
